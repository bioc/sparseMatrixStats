Changes in version 1.17
+ Fix handling of missing values in `rowSums2` if `cols` is a boolean vector
+ Implement optimized code path for `rowSums2` and `rowMeans2` if `cols` is provided

Changes in version 1.15
+ Throw error if length of 'center' in colVars, colSds, colMads (and
corrresponding row-functions) does not match size of 'x'.
This behavior was never supported by `sparseMatrixStats` and previously
could return incorrect results. This change matches the upcoming behavior of
matrixStats (https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats/issues/254).


Changes in version 1.13
+ Make sparseMatrixStats compatible with matrixStats release v1.0.0.
In particular change 'useNames'to 'TRUE' by default.
+ Add fast path for 'rowSums2(x, cols = logical_vector)'
+ Add useNames parameter to all functions
+ fix incomplete method signature of rowQuantiles
+

Changes in version 1.3
+ Avoid C++14 features. This should fix the reoccuring installation problems.
+ Support center argument in colVars (and friends). This can speed up
the calculation if both are needed. Note that center must be a proper
estimate of the column means.
+ Fix bug that broke test on ARM architectures
+ Add extensive section on how to fix installation problems to README
+ Fix compatibility with matrixStats v.0.58.0
+ Fix bug in colCounts, colAnys, colAlls, colRanks if the sparse matrix
contained explicit zeros.


Changes in version 1.2
+ Use numerically stable algorithms for sum, mean, and variance
+ Implement dedicated function for rowSums2, rowMeans2, rowVars
 which avoid transposing the input matrix to call the colXXX version
+ Support logical input (lgCMatrix) for all methods that matrixStats
 supports. Introduce new class xgCMatrix as union class of dgCMatrix
 and lgCMatrix.
+ Fix bug in colWeightedVars() that returned slightly off results on
 Linux, because there abs() internally returns integers instead of
 doubles
+ Change argument name in colRanks from `preserve.shape` to
 `preserveShape` to match matrixStats (thanks @LTLA for reporting)
+ Fix bug in low-level `quantile_sparse()` related to +- Inf
  (thanks @LTLA for reporting)
+ Move MatrixGenerics from Imports to Depends so that loading
 matrixStats does not break calls to sparseMatrixStats
 (thanks @hpages for reporting)
+ Fix bug in [col|row]Quantile which ignored drop argument if
  length(probs) == 1

Changes in version 1.0.5 (2020-05-17)
+ Fix links in documentation to get rid of WARNINGS

Changes in version 1.0.4 (2020-05-17)
+ Fix bugs in colTabulates
+ Update documentation to avoid warnings in build on Windows

Changes in version 1.0.3 (2020-05-17)
+ Fix bug in colAnys and colAlls if value = TRUE

Changes in version 1.0.2 (2020-05-10)
+ Fix bug in colMaxs, colMins related to missing values

Changes in version 1.0.1 (2020-05-08)
+ Fix bugs in colMaxs, colMins, colAnys
+ Fix bug in colLogSumExps


Changes in version 0.0.99 (2020-04-03)
+ Submitted to Bioconductor
