Emergency fix (1.2.1)
+ Make sparseMatrixStats compatible with version v.0.58.0 of matrixStats
 (i.e., add na.rm to colAvgsPerRowSet)

Release version (1.2)
+ Use numerically stable algorithms for sum, mean, and variance
+ Implement dedicated function for rowSums2, rowMeans2, rowVars
 which avoid transposing the input matrix to call the colXXX version
+ Support logical input (lgCMatrix) for all methods that matrixStats
 supports. Introduce new class xgCMatrix as union class of dgCMatrix
 and lgCMatrix.
+ Fix bug in colWeightedVars() that returned slightly off results on
 Linux, because there abs() internally returns integers instead of
 doubles
+ Change argument name in colRanks from `preserve.shape` to
 `preserveShape` to match matrixStats (thanks @LTLA for reporting)
+ Fix bug in low-level `quantile_sparse()` related to +- Inf
  (thanks @LTLA for reporting)
+ Move MatrixGenerics from Imports to Depends so that loading
 matrixStats does not break calls to sparseMatrixStats
 (thanks @hpages for reporting)
+ Fix bug in [col|row]Quantile which ignored drop argument if
  length(probs) == 1
